# Goal

The goal of ECS here is to allow us to build the game logic using ECS.
HUD and other stuffs should not be rendered using ECS (probably), and might be better off using the basic objects.

# Usage

Current goal is to use this repo as a boilerplate rather than a module.
Might consider making it a module/package in the future if I need.
